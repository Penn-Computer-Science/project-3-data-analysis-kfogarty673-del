## Reflection
Answer briefly:
- What went well in your project?
    - Something that went well in this survey was a clear distinction between GPA and sports played.
- What was the most challenging part?
    - The most challening part was thinking of questions to ask people, along with organizing my findings.
- If you had more time, what would you do differently?
    - I would have asked questions about which specific type of sport someone plays, and then compare that to their GPA.
