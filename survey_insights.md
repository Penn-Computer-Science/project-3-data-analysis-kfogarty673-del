**What I found**
- In this survey, I was asking people how often they watch and play sports, and compared it to their GPA and school enjoyment level. I also asked their favorite number.
- With my survey, I found that people who don't play sports have a higher average GPA than those who do play sports.
- Another thing I found with my survey is that the average favorite number, regardless of GPA, is "67".
- Next, I found out that most people have around a 4.0 GPA.
- My bar chart helped visualize the fact that people who don't play sports have a higher average GPA.
- My histograph showed how most people have around a 4.0 GPA, and my scatterplot shows how the average favorite number is near to "67". This shows how sports-related culture can be shown in people who don't watch or engage in sports.
